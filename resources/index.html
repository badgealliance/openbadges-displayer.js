  <h1>Baked Badge Demo</h1>
  <p>Back in September, Mike wrote <a href="http://stenington.tumblr.com/post/62155201834/display-without-the-displayer-api">a great blog post</a> where he pulled the assertion url from a baked badge included on the page. Since then, we've changed the specification to allow for the full badge to be baked.
  </p>
  <p>This demo shows a badge with the new style baking being unbaked in the page. From the end users perspective, the only thing they would need to do is add the badges to the page, and then include a bit of Javascript.</p>

  <h2>The Badge</h2>
  <div><img src="demobadge.png"></div>

  <h2>The Badge Title and Description</h2>
  <p>Extracted from the baked badge in the browser, no server side code is called or necessary</p>
  <div id="assertion">
